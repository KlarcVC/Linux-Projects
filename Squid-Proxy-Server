# 🐙 Squid Proxy Server on Linux

## 🧠 Objective

A **proxy server** is an application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource. Squid Proxy enhances security, speeds up browsing, and controls access.

### ✨ Benefits:
- Hides real IP location
- Enables secure browsing
- Increases browsing speed with caching
- Controls access to blocked or restricted sites

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- OS: Linux (CentOS-based, assumed from `dnf`)
- Tool: Squid
- Config File: `/etc/squid/squid.conf`
- Default Port: `3128`

## 📦 Installation & Configuration

### 🔍 Step 1: Check if Squid is installed
```bash
rpm -qa | grep squid

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- OS: Linux (CentOS-based, assumed from `dnf`)
- Tool: Squid
- Config File: `/etc/squid/squid.conf`
- Default Port: `3128`

## 📦 Installation & Configuration

### 🔍 Step 1: Check if Squid is installed
```bash
rpm -qa | grep squid

📥 Step 2: Install Squid (if not installed)

bash
dnf install squid* -y

▶️ Step 3: Start & Enable the Service

bash
systemctl start squid
systemctl enable squid
systemctl status squid

⚙️ Step 4: Configure squid.conf

Open the configuration file:

bash
vi /etc/squid/squid.conf

•    Scroll to the HTTP port section (3128).
    •    Scroll up to view the ACL (Access Control List) section.
    •    Comment out default ACLs (we’ll add custom ones).

Example Custom ACL:

conf
acl localnet src 10.x.x.x/24
http_access allow localnet

✅ This allows HTTP access to all devices within the 10.x.x.x/24 subnet.

🔒 Step 5: Block Specific Sites
    1.    Create a file to list sites to block:

bash
vi /etc/squid/blocksites

add:

.facebook.com
.youtube.com

    2.    Re-open squid.conf and add:

conf
acl blocksites url_regex "/etc/squid/blocksites"
http_access deny blocksites

3.    Save and exit:

bash
:wq

🧪 Testing
    •    Try browsing to blocked sites on a client machine using the proxy. They should be denied.
    •    Check the proxy access logs:

bash
tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log

🛠️ Management
    •    Restart: systemctl restart squid
    •    Check logs: cat /var/log/squid/access.log
    •    Reload config: squid -k reconfigure

📝 Notes
    •    Remember to open port 3128 on your firewall if needed.
    •    Squid configuration is powerful; explore more ACL rules for fine-grained control.
