🐧 Linux Projects by Klarc Clarabal
Welcome to my Linux Projects repository!

This space showcases my hands-on experience with Linux system administration, server configuration, and troubleshooting tasks — all part of my learning journey and practical application of IT and cybersecurity skills.

Each project reflects real-world scenarios tackled using tools like Postfix, Apache, and various Linux utilities, inspired by training material such as the "Complete Linux Training Course to Get Your Dream IT Job" on Udemy.

Stay tuned — more projects and documentation are coming soon.
